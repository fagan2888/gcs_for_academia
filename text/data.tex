Additional data is provided by \ac{GCS}. \ac{GCS} does not use a set panel; rather, respondents are visitors to the pages that have an agreement with \ac{GCS}. \ac{GCS} does not collect demographics prior to the interview. Instead, \ac{GCS} imputes demographics  (age, gender, income, geography, see Table~\ref{tab:data}), relying on browsing history (the types of sites) and IP address (geolocation) to model the characteristics. Note that neither the browsing history nor the IP address are provided to the survey creator. The imputation model relies on CPS Internet Users Supplement \citep{varianGoogle2015}.
