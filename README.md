# Google Consumer Surveys for academic research

We wanted to use Google Consumer Surveys (GCS) for some preliminary academic research. Because GCS asks questions of individual respondents, it falls, in principle, under the type of data collection subject to review by our university's Institutional Review Board (IRB). As it turns out, this was new ground, at least for our university's IRB, and we did not find much guidance doing internet searches either.

This document is the description of the GCS method of collecting data that we submitted to our IRB. Our IRB, in turn,

- determined that our particular GCS survey fell under the "benign use" exemption
- imposed on us that any additional questions could fall under the same protocol, as long as they were also "benign"

Thus, our submission to our IRB can be found in [text/gcs_for_academics_irb_request.pdf](text/gcs_for_academics_irb_request.pdf). Your mileage may vary.
